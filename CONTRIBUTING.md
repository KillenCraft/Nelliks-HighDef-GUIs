## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [github@scottkillen.com](mailto:github@scottkillen.com).

## Reporting Problems

When reporting problems, please include:

  * The Minecraft version
  * Any involved mods
  * A description of how to reproduce the problem
  * A screenshot of the issue. (This is optional, but it will go along way to the speedy resolution of the problem.)

## Nominating Mods

This project aims to cover every mod with every version of Minecraft. When nominating a mod, please include:

  * The name of the mod
  * A link to the mod
  * A short description of why this mod should be prioritized. (This is optional, but it will help us determine how to schedule this mod's inclusion.)

## Contributing Textures

We need your help. When submitting textures, please understand that you must use [Adobe Photoshop](http://www.photoshop.com/) to create dialogs that follow the Nellik style. Everything you need, except Photoshop itself is available in this project. Addtionally, *any textures you use must be your own or available with compatible licensing to this project*.

To get started, <a href="https://www.clahub.com/agreements/ScottKillen/Nellik-s-HighDef-GUIs">sign the Contributor License Agreement</a>.

### Submitting changes
We recommend the following workflow:

  1. Fork the project.
  2. Check out the development branch.
  3. Create a new branch for your changes.
  4. Complete your work.
  5. Review your changes and test in-game.
  6. Check in your changes.
  7. Submit a pull request from the branch you created in #3 above.
  8. Return to #2 and move to the next mod, following the steps you as you did before.

### Conventions

Play with this project and you'll get the hang of it. We strive to do the following:

  * You **must** contribute both the source Photoshop (.psd) file as well as the resulting .png GUI texture. These files should be kept side by side in the same folder, just like the project is currently structured.
  * Your Photoshop files should follow good [Photoshop etiquette](http://www.creativebloq.com/photoshop/etiquette-2131974).
  * You must place the textures you design in the folder that corresponds to the earliest version of Minecraft that this GUI appeared.
  * If a texture is dropped by future versions, or if a texture is renamed, you can exclude files from different minecraft versions of the pack by adding the obsolete texture to the `.exclude` file in the "assets" folder of the first version where the texture should sto appearing.
  * When possible (such as when adding new icons that will be ignored by earlier versions of Minecraft), choose to change the original file rather than creating a new fersion of the GUI.
